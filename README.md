## Exploring terrorism through GTD 

Lack of understanding and awareness about global terrorism leads to diverse opinions and common misconceptions among civilians. Information on the subject is commonly ignored by the civilians who are not affected directly by the dangers. For the most part, terrorism is considered unpredictable and unfortunate calamity that strikes some parts of the world more than others. Based on the location of the events, people at large have very limited information about any such event happening in other parts of the world and hence react differently. In this project, we focus on terrorism by analysing the dataset provided by START (Study of Terrorism and Response to Terrorism) Consortium to extract meaningful patterns and statistics related to global terrorism.

The main objective is to visualize the Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD) so that it can be useful for common man to understand the impact of various terrorist activities. Results from analyses as ours shall enable organizations and individuals to improve awareness of the severity of global terrorism, and also provide a reliable reference for counterterrorism initiatives.

<b>I</b> Quantitative analysis of global terrorist activities and various attributes such as time, location and terrorist organizations involved in the activities
<b>II</b>  Data pre-processing, including data cleaning (such as missing value processing and data conversion), feature selection, and data splitting to treat missing              values row-wise.
<b>III</b> Visual analysis on the cleaned dataset producing several visualizations interpreted seeking answers to various questions posed at the beginning of the                    analysis. 
We conclude our project by consolidating all interpretations in a finite set of results.
